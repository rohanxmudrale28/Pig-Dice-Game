# Pig-Dice-Game
PIG DICE  A classic dice game implemented in Python. Players take turns rolling a die. If they roll a 1, their turn ends and they score 0 points for that round. If they roll any other number, they can choose to roll again or bank their score. The first player to reach a target score wins.
